# Design Patterns in C#

Welcome to my learning repository for **Design Patterns** in C#. This project is part of my journey into software design, focusing on reusable, scalable, and maintainable code using popular design patterns.

## What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They are templates that help structure code in a clean and efficient way.

## üõ†Ô∏è Patterns Covered

| Pattern Name         | Type         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Singleton            | Creational   | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access |
| Factory Method       | Creational   | Delegates the instantiation of objects to subclasses                        |
| Abstract Factory     | Creational   | Produces families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes |
| Builder              | Creational   | Constructs complex objects step-by-step                                     |
| Prototype            | Creational   | Creates new objects by copying existing ones (cloning)                      |
| Adapter              | Structural   | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together                             |
| Bridge               | Structural   | Separates an object‚Äôs abstraction from its implementation                   |
| Composite            | Structural   | Treats individual objects and composites uniformly                          |
| Decorator            | Structural   | Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically                                |
| Facade               | Structural   | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem                      |
| Flyweight            | Structural   | Reduces memory usage by sharing common data across many objects             |
| Proxy                | Structural   | Provides a placeholder to control access to another object                  |
| Chain of Responsibility | Behavioral | Passes a request along a chain of handlers                                  |
| Command              | Behavioral   | Encapsulates a request as an object                                         |
| Interpreter          | Behavioral   | Defines a grammar and interprets sentences in the language                  |
| Iterator             | Behavioral   | Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially              |
| Mediator             | Behavioral   | Centralizes communication between components                                |
| Memento              | Behavioral   | Captures and restores an object's internal state                            |
| Observer             | Behavioral   | Defines a dependency between objects so that one changes, all are notified  |
| State                | Behavioral   | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes      |
| Strategy             | Behavioral   | Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime                                   |
| Template Method      | Behavioral   | Defines the program skeleton but lets subclasses override certain steps     |
| Visitor              | Behavioral   | Allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying them |
